# brainf_ck-compiler
Compiles Brainfuck source code to C.

**Note:** This is a school project and was rushly made; it required me about half a day's worth of continuous work. I know the code quality sucks and needs a ton of refactoring, but it will do for my purposes. Expect to encounter bugs especially on more sophisticated source codes, however, compiling Brainf_ck's "Hello world" program works just fine. üòÅ
